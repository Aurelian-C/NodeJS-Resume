# Assignment operator `=`

Assignment operator `=` is used to ==assign a value to a variable==. The assignment operation evaluates to the assigned value. _Chaining the assignment operator is possible in order to ==assign a single value to multiple variables==_.

## Syntax

```js
// Simple assignment
var a = value;
let a = value;
const a = value;

// Chaining assignment
let x = 5
let y = 10
let z = 25
x = y // x is 10
x = y = z // x, y and z are all 25
```
