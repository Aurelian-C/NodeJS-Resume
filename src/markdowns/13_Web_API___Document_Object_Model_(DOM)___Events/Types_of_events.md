# Types of Events

Events are fired to notify code of "changes" that may affect code execution. Events can be triggered by the user action (e.g. clicking the mouse button or tapping keyboard), or generated by APIs to represent the progress of an asynchronous task. It can also be triggered programmatically, such as by calling the [`HTMLElement.click()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/click) method of an element, or by defining the event, then sending it to a specified target using [`EventTarget.dispatchEvent()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/dispatchEvent).

==There are many types of events, some of which use other interfaces based on the main [`Event`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event) interface. `Event` itself contains the properties and methods which are common to all events==.

==Each event is represented by an object that is based on the `Event` interface, and may have additional custom fields and/or functions to provide information about what happened==.

Some events, such as `click`, are available on nearly any element. Others are more specific and only useful in certain situations: for example, the [`play`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement/play_event) event is only available on some elements, such as [`<video>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video).

## Interfaces based on Event

When an event occurs in HTML, the event belongs to a certain event object, like a mouse click event belongs to the [`MouseEvent`](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/obj_mouseevent.asp) object.  All event objects are based on the `Event` Object, and inherit all of their properties and methods:

| Event Object                                           | Description                     |
| :----------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------ |
| [Event](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/obj_event.asp) | The parent of all event objects |

Below is a list of most common event interfaces which are based on the main `Event` interface, with links to their respective documentation. Note that all event interfaces have names which end in "Event":
