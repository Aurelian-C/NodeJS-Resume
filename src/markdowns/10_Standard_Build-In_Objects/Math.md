# `Math` build-in object

==`Math` is a built-in object that has properties and methods for mathematical constants and functions. It's not a function object==.

`Math` works with the [`Number`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number) type. It doesn't work with [`BigInt`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/BigInt).

## Description

==Unlike many other global objects, `Math` is not a constructor==.

==All properties and methods of `Math` are static.== You refer to the constant pi as `Math.PI` and you call the sine function as `Math.sin(x)`, where `x` is the method's argument. Constants are defined with the full precision of real numbers in JavaScript.
