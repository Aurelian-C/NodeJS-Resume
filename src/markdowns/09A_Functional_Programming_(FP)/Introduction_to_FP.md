# Introduction to Functional Programming

What is Functional Programming (FP)? FP is all about separation of concerns, which Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) does as well. FP is all about packaging our code into separate chunks so that everything is well organized.

We see in OOP how classes are used to store related data (properties) and methods into single object. FP has the idea as well of separating concerns, but it separates data and functions. A functional programmer views the world as data, and then this data gets interacted with, but we're not going to combine data and functions as one piece or one object.

Most FP languages don't have these concepts of classes and methods that belong to objects. Instead, ==functions operate on well defined data structures (like arrays and objects), rather than actually belonging to that data structure, like belonging to an object==.

==When it comes to FP we have a very important pillar called **pure functions**==, unlike OOP where we have four pillars of encapsulation, abstraction, polymorphism and inheritance.

==The idea in FP is that there is a **separation between data of a program and the behavior of a program**, and **all objects created in FP are immutable**==, and that means once something is created, it cannot be changed.
